# TheraPet

## Desktop Digital Therapy Pet 
*All spritework is original*

This was my school turned into passion project when I was taking my first software engineering course.
I set out to design a desktop program that will house a digital pet that you can:
- *Choose which type of pet to raise*
- *Play with*
- *Feed*
- *Talk to*

## My project specifications before development:

However, this is no ordinary pet. This pet will be there with you through thick and 
thin, and give you motivation suited to the mood you're in! As you take care of your pet,
and your pet watches out for you, this give-and-take will create a bond greater than
just data through a screen. I think this application
/ desktop game will be great for people of all ages who get stressed or overwhelmed
and want a little pick-me-up while doing work on a PC. 

As a human being who sometimes finds themselves overwhelmed by life, I think I personally 
would like to use this application once I finish it. When things get tough, I always have an idea
of what I would like to hear as motivation / consolement at times, but am never quite sure where to find
what I need to hear. Also, seeing motivational messages soley written in text
lacks impact in my opinion. I want to personify these messages I would find helpful
to hear, by giving these bits of motivation a mouth and a character it would come from. 
That's where the *pet game* aspect comes in. The time and effort you
put into taking care of the pet would create a greater sense of meaning and gratification
when receiving messages, and in turn, be more impactful as well.

I've always loved video games and have keen interest in making my own as well, so this project will be meaningful
to me in more ways than one.

##Phase 4: Task 3

If I had more time to work on my project, I would have liked to be able to:
- Refactor the duplication in my BagPanel and ShopPanel classes
- Implement abstract classes to refactor duplicate code surrounding actions dependent on pet and food type
- Refactor some conditional loops to instead make use of exceptions specific to the case
- Refactor the passing of "this" to each Panel in PetAppGUI main class to improve coupling and cohesion
- Refactor Panel classes to make use of the Observer Pattern learned in class
